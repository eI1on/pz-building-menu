 OCT 24

Changelog:
[list]
Main mod:
[list]
[*] Added all missing corner buildables
[*] Introduced a better pillar placement detection system: The build system now automatically identifies when a pillar is necessary at the corner or intersection of walls. Pillar placement dynamically adjusts based on the surrounding wall layout. When placing a corner, the adjacent tiles in the southern and eastern directions will be checked to determine if a pillar is required. Additionally, if a wall is placed on a tile already containing a pillar, the pillar will be removed to prevent the "structure not being recognized as indoors" bug.
[*] Implemented a corner wall merging system: When a newly placed wall can form a valid corner with an existing wall on the same tile, the system will automatically transform the walls into a corner structure by merging them intro a corner piece. This applies to all wall types that have a valid corner attributed (the majority will have the corner object in the menu too).
[*] [b]Known issue[/b]: If corner walls from certain addons cannot be destroyed, this is due to a limitation in the game itself, which prevents assigning and managing the [b]CornerNorthWall[/b] and [b]CornerWestWall[/b] properties of corner buildables
[*] Adjusted material costs for several objects:
[list]
[*] Floor Rugs: Thread cost reduced from 5 >> 3
[*] Rusty Mesh Floors: Updated materials from Metal Sheet 1 >> Small Sheet Metal 2; Wire 2
[*] Steel Bars Floors: Material changed from Metal Sheet 1 >> Metal Bars 2; Small Sheet Metal 1
[*] Other Industrial Floors: Switched from Metal Sheet 1 >> Small Sheet Metal 2
[/list]
